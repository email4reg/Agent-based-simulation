##Objective and Background
In this project we are trying to simulate the complex financial system using an agent-based approach. This idea was first sparked by the econophysics course during which Prof Chen Yu(The University of Tokyo) mentioned some very interesting models built to simulate the finacial market. However, many of these models cannot simulate this complexity with the support of market diversity, consisting of only two or three kinds of market members. Thus we are trying to avoid this weakness and to demonstrate the impact brought by the diversity. Also, this project is a course-based project and we wish that if you are going to cite our code and research report, please use this url: https://github.com/yfmaRamos/Agent-based-simulation.

##Abstract
This project breifly introduces 5 kinds of agents and only one stock.The agents include speculators, idoits, intelligencies, rich-people and supervisor.All of the agents should make their decisions at same time, and the sum of their decisions will decide the stock price. They share same attributes while maintain their difference in the behavior and decision process.Some may have little intelligence while others are not. The most intelligent agents will use special techniques in machine learning and reinforcement learning to help themselves to make decisions which is kind of THRILLING!
