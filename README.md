##Objective and Background
In this project we are trying to simulate the complex financial system using an agent-based approach. This idea was first sparked by the econophysics course during which Prof Chen Yu(Tokyo University) mentioned some very interesting models built to simulate the finacial market. However, many of these models cannot simulate this complexity with the support of market diversity, consisting of only two or three kinds of market members. Thus we are trying to avoid this weakness and to demonstrate the impact brought by the diversity. Also, this project is a course-based project and we wish that if you are going to cite our code and research report, please use this url: https://github.com/yfmaRamos/Agent-based-simulation.
